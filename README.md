This is a collection of Hytale mods I've made.

They're generally tested and ready for use. The exception is the WIP pack, which I use to store whatever I've been working on that I want to save.

## Known issues

**Beam Blocks:**
 * Only supports Softwood at the moment. (WIP!)
 * Textures may not line up perfectly with vanilla beams, due to block rotation mis-aligning it. I can't fix it.

## Editing mods

Edit modpacks on a world that you can easily restart at will. _(So ideally not a dedicated server.)_

Not everything hot-reloads cleanly at the moment, and sometimes the game can enter an odd state where your changes are not fully applied until a server restart. This especially applies to new files, like block textures or newly generated icons.

New or WIP packs should be put in their own modpack folder.

Language (.lang) files should be named after the modpack, to avoid conflicts. I'm not entirely sure if this is strictly required, but when I had a file called server.lang, it overrode all built-in language translations, rather than adding a few new ones, so this seems to be safer.

## Installing

**Before adding to a dedicated server:**
1. Stop the server to save everything and kick everyone.
2. Back up everything on the server except the Server/ folder and Assets.zip file.
3. Fully remove the folders of the modpacks being changed.

**Install:**
1. Place the updated modpacks in the server's "mods/" folder, e.g. "mods/ninitale.BeamBlocks/"
2. Restart server.
