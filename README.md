## Editing mods

New or WIP packs should be put in their own modpack folder.

Edit them clientside. Editing live on a dedicated server is unreliable as files don't update properly.

The asset editor also struggles to detect files that were modified outside the editor itself, sometimes. A game restart can fix it.

Tested and functioning packs can be merged into ninitale.Ninitale.

## Installing

**Before adding to the server:**
1. Stop the server to save everything and kick everyone. (This made FTP access not work so server might need to restart anyway idk)
2. Back up everything on the server except the Server/ folder and Assets.zip file.
3. Remove the folder of the modpack being changed.

**Install:**
1. Place the updated modpack in the server's "mods/" folder, e.g. "mods/ninitale.Ninitale/"
2. Restart server.
